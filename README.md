# Signal processing examples

This repository was entirely made using Jupyter Notebooks. They are simple examples built for my 
lectures as a professor of the Acoustical Engineering of the Federal University of Santa Maria
(Brazil). The notebooks are about Digital Signal Processing and Signals and Systems. They cover the
following chapters:

1. Introduction to signals (what they are, transformations of the independent variable, periodic
signals, exponential signals, impulse, power, energy, mean value, RMS, etc)

2. Introduction to systems (what they are, memory, causality, stability, linearity, time invariance,
linear and time invariant systems and convolution)

3. Spectral estimation (the Fourier series, the Fourier transform, properties, convolution theorem,
use of windows, etc)

4. The Laplace Transform

5. Sampling, quantization and the Discrete Fourier Transform

6. Statistical signal processing (auto and cross-correlation, auto and cross spectrum,
Welch's method, coherence, estimation of the Frequency Response Function)

For now, the examples are being implemented and will be available as soon as they are ready.
